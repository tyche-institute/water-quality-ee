# Model Card — Water Quality Compliance Risk Estimator

> **Structure:** Mitchell et al. 2019, *Model Cards for Model Reporting*.
> Companion to `docs/datasheet.md` (data provenance), `docs/ai_act_self_assessment.md` (risk tier), `docs/fria_light.md` (fundamental-rights impact).

## 1. Model details

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Model family** | Binary classifier over a fixed feature vector of ~70 columns |
| **Primary model** | LightGBM (gradient-boosted decision trees) — `best_model.joblib` |
| **Baselines** | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, sklearn GradientBoosting — `trained_models.joblib` |
| **Version** | 0.1.0 (aligns with `pyproject.toml`) |
| **Training pipeline commit** | Git SHA of the commit that produced the published `snapshot.json` — recorded in the signed evidence package (see `scripts/sign_snapshot.py`) |
| **Developer** | TalTech Masinõpe student team, 2026 |
| **Licence** | Apache License 2.0 (code + artefacts) — see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` |
| **Contact** | GitHub issues at [`tyche-institute/water-quality-ee`](https://github.com/tyche-institute/water-quality-ee) |
| **Citation** | `CITATION.cff` (Zenodo-compatible) |

The four trained models share one preprocessing stack (`src/features.py`) and one target definition (`compliant ∈ {0, 1}` from `hinnang`).

## 2. Intended use

### Primary intended use

Public decision support. Probability P(violation) for the most recent laboratory sample at a monitored site, rendered alongside the official Terviseamet `hinnang` on [h2oatlas.ee](https://h2oatlas.ee) so a citizen can see both signals side by side.

### Intended users

- Members of the public consulting the map before swimming or to contextualise their drinking-water supply.
- TalTech course reviewers assessing the project.
- Water-quality researchers and civic-tech developers wanting a worked pipeline on Estonian open data.

### Out-of-scope uses

The model must **not** be used for:

- Regulatory decision-making (closing a beach, recalling a batch of water, issuing enforcement).
- Medical or clinical advice.
- Replacing, pre-empting or overriding Terviseamet's official `hinnang`.
- Predicting future water quality beyond the most recent sample date.
- Generalising to water sources outside Estonia or to parameters outside the 15 measured ones.
- Safety-critical control loops (e.g. triggering chlorination, closing a valve).

Using the model for any of these is a category error: the target is a *historical label reproduction* task, not a physical model of water safety. See `docs/ml_framing.md`.

## 3. Factors

Relevant factors that affect model behaviour and were evaluated:

| Factor | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain** | `supluskoha`, `veevark`, `basseinid`, `joogivesi` | Parameter availability differs sharply per domain (§6). |
| **Year** | 2021–2026 | Temporal validation split: train ≤ 2024, test ≥ 2025. |
| **Season** | winter / spring / summer / autumn | Bathing-site activity concentrated in summer. |
| **County (maakond)** | 15 Estonian counties + `unknown` | Leakage-safe encoding via `fit_county_mapping` on train only. |
| **Parameter measurement schedule** | Per-probe vs quarterly vs annual | Chemistry in `veevark` is 5–7% populated per probe but 97.9% of "missing" chemistry is measured at the same site on a different probe (periodic scheduling). |

Factors **not** evaluated: demographic subgroups of site users (not in the data), long-range temporal trends beyond 6 years, comparison with non-Estonian corpora.

## 4. Metrics

### Decision metrics

Priority metric: **Recall on class 0 (violation)**. A false negative on h2oatlas.ee displays low probability of violation for water that actually violates norms — this is the highest-harm error.

Operational metrics reported:

- ROC-AUC (class separation)
- Precision / Recall at the default 0.5 threshold
- Precision / Recall at `best_threshold_max_recall_at_precision(min_precision=0.7)` (decision-support threshold)
- Calibration curve + Brier score (LightGBM only, `06_advanced_models.ipynb`)
- SHAP values for per-prediction attribution (LightGBM only)

### Headline results (temporal split: train ≤ 2024, test ≥ 2025)

| Model | Recall₀ | Precision₀ | F1₀ | ROC-AUC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic Regression | 0.827 | 0.454 | 0.586 | 0.936 |
| Random Forest | 0.949 | 0.919 | 0.934 | 0.992 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.954 | 0.946 | 0.950 | 0.994 |
| **LightGBM** | **0.956** | **0.881** | **0.917** | **0.988** |

LightGBM is published as `best_model.joblib` because of native missing-value handling and calibrated probabilities; its ROC-AUC is slightly below GB but the operational curve (Recall at fixed Precision) is equivalent.

### Per-domain metrics

Per-domain confusion matrices and Recall₀/Precision₀ are reported in `notebooks/05_evaluation.ipynb`. This surfaces weakness in `joogivesi` (small n, 376 probes) and strength in `veevark` (large n, rich chemistry).

For the currently published latest-per-location slice, reproducible per-domain and hard-case metrics now also live in:

- `scripts/evaluate_live_snapshot.py`
- `docs/live_snapshot_evaluation.md`
- `data/processed/live_snapshot_evaluation.json`

## 5. Evaluation data

- **Corpus:** 69,536 labelled probes from four Terviseamet domains, 2021–2026. See `docs/datasheet.md` §3.
- **Split strategy:** temporal. Train ≤ 2024, test ≥ 2025. This is the relevant generalisation axis for a risk estimator that must work on samples the lab has not yet produced.
- **Secondary split:** `TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)` CV on the training portion, reported in `06_advanced_models.ipynb`.
- **Per-domain evaluation:** `X_test.groupby('domain')` over the same trained model weights (no re-training).

Known caveat: the test period (2025–2026) contains an unusual share of violations (higher than the 2021–2024 baseline), reflecting a methodological change in labelling or a real-world shift we cannot distinguish from open data alone. See `docs/phase_10_findings.md` §4 and the Terviseamet inquiry (Q5, Q6).

## 6. Training data

- **Source:** Terviseamet opendata XML (`vtiav.sm.ee/index.php/opendata/`).
- **Feature engineering:** `src/features.py::engineer_features` — time features, ratio-to-norm, missing indicators, categorical encoding.
- **Target:** `compliant` derived from `hinnang` field (`"ei vasta nõuetele"` → 0, else → 1).
- **Class balance:** ~12% violations (class 0).
- **Missing-value policy:** median imputation via `SimpleImputer`, fit on train only. LightGBM uses native missing handling and ignores the imputed values for splits.
- **Scaling:** `RobustScaler`, fit on train only.
- **Location deduplication:** raw `location` contains year-over-year renames (e.g. "Harku järve supluskoht" → "Harku järve rand"); `location_key` normalisation via `src/data_loader.py::normalize_location` collapses these.

See `docs/datasheet.md` for full data provenance.

## 7. Quantitative analyses

### Disaggregated performance

Reported in `notebooks/05_evaluation.ipynb`:

- Per-domain confusion matrix × 4 models.
- Per-year breakdown on the test set (`year == 2025`, `year == 2026`).
- SHAP summary plots for LightGBM (global + per-domain).
- Calibration curve for LightGBM with isotonic regression overlay.
- Live-slice calibration tables per domain in `data/processed/live_snapshot_evaluation.json`.

### Known performance gaps

- **joogivesi** has the smallest n (376 probes) and the highest proportion of `hidden_pass` (iron/manganese slightly exceeding EU threshold on label = compliant). Confidence intervals are wide.
- **basseinid** carries the `free_chlorine_deviation` feature, which was retrained in Phase 11 after the pool-norm correction (`NORMS_POOL` free_chlorine `[0.2, 0.6]` → `[0.5, 1.5]`). Pre-Phase-11 model artefacts are obsolete.

## 8. Ethical considerations

### Sensitive uses

The model displays a risk probability on a public map. Misreading that probability as a medical or binary safety signal could lead a user to swim in unsafe water or avoid safe water. The UI mitigates this by:

1. Always showing the official Terviseamet `hinnang` **first** and the model layer **second**.
2. Displaying explicit disclaimers ("This is not an official health assessment").
3. A `/verify` page (Phase 3 of the compliance roadmap) that lets users cryptographically verify the snapshot's integrity.

### Fairness

No demographic attributes of site users are present in the data. The model operates on site-level measurements, not on people. Geographic coverage is Estonia-wide; whether sites in smaller counties receive equivalent measurement frequency is a data-quality question for Terviseamet, not a model fairness issue.

### Legal basis

The data is published under Estonian open-data licence. Personal data (inspector names appearing in XML metadata) is not used by the model and not redistributed on the map.

### AI Act status

In its current configuration (public visualisation, no operational control, no regulatory decision), the system is **not** a high-risk AI system under EU AI Act Annex III. Applicable obligations: Art 50 (transparency, already fulfilled via UI disclaimers). See `docs/ai_act_self_assessment.md` for the full self-assessment and the list of triggers that would move the system into high-risk.

## 9. Caveats and recommendations

- The target `compliant` is a function of the same parameters the model sees. ROC-AUC > 0.99 on a random split is expected and does not indicate general physical understanding.
- 3.1% of probes are `hidden_violation` (label = violation, no published parameter exceeds any norm). The model cannot predict these from open data alone; see `docs/phase_10_findings.md` §3.
- 10.7% are `hidden_pass` (label = compliant, checker flags violation). Dominant source: pool turbidity at 0.5–2.0 NTU labelled compliant. Likely reflects an operational tolerance band the open data does not expose.
- The published snapshot now exposes `audit_bucket`, `data_quality_flags`, and `uncertainty_level`, so these structural cases are not hidden behind a single probability.
- Pool risk probabilities shown on h2oatlas.ee for probes trained with the pre-Phase-11 `NORMS_POOL` are systematically too high; Phase 11 retrain rectifies this for new snapshots.
- Schema drift: location names change year-over-year; aggregations by raw `location` are unsafe — use `location_key` only.
- **Recommended refresh:** weekly + first-of-month (current CI cadence in `.github/workflows/citizen-snapshot.yml`). Move sooner if Terviseamet confirms faster upstream updates (inquiry Q6).

### Abstention policy

The public product now distinguishes between:

- normal ML interpretation,
- caution,
- abstain / insufficient published basis.

Current policy: `docs/ABSTENTION_POLICY.md`.
